I made some changes to add functions to this application, including the following:
1. in script.js, I use getProducts function to retrieve the product data and then displays it in the "Products" section.

2. Add Product Functionality:The script handles the form submission for adding new products. When the form is submitted, it sends the product data to the server via an HTTP POST request. If successful, the product list is refreshed to include the newly added product.

3. feedback function not finished

4. backend changes includes:Updated Controller Functions:

The controller was updated with functions to handle the retrieval and addition of cat food products.

A new data model was created to represent cat food products. This includes fields for the product title, brand, image URL, description, and an array for storing user ratings.
